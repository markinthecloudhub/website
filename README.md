# Bakāsana Wellness — Static Site

This is a clean, WordPress-free rebuild of **bakasanawellness.com** as a static site (HTML/CSS/JS).

## What's included
- `index.html` — single-page layout keeping the same template/sections
- `styles.css` — modern responsive styling
- `script.js` — small UX helpers
- `assets/` — put your images here (`hero.jpg`, `sarah.jpg`, `yoga.jpg`, `reiki.jpg`, `oil.jpg`)

> Email was protected on the original site, so `mailto:info@bakasanawellness.com` is used here as a placeholder. Update as needed.

## How to use
1. Replace placeholder images in `/assets` with your real images.
2. Edit any text in `index.html` if needed.
3. Deploy with GitHub Pages:
   - Create a new repo, push this folder.
   - In GitHub repo settings → Pages → Source: `main` branch, `/ (root)`.
   - Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Notes
- No WordPress, PHP, or plugins.
- Fonts served from Google Fonts. You can self-host if preferred.
- Fully responsive; lightweight; easy to maintain.
